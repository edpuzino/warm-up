# warm-up

 * I am doing the fifteen minute warm up in the practice-arrays.js and practice-objects.js files and the are run by entering node practice-arrays.js and so on.

  * I am doing the one hour warm up in the respective files, practice-linked-lists, queues, stacks, and trees. and are run the same way as above.

   * This first day of warm ups most of my time was spent trying to understand what to do and trying to get this thing organized, I hope to be able to finish up the warm ups in the allotted time in the near future. I want to eventually rebuild stacks and queues to work as arrays instead of linked lists which is how they are built now.
